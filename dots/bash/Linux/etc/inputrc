## This line sets readline to display possible completions using different
## colors to indicate their file types. The colors are determined by the
## environmental variable LS_COLORS.
set colored-stats on

## This line sets auto completion to ignore cases.
set completion-ignore-case on

## This line sets 3 to be the maximum number of characters to be the common
## prefix to display for completions. If the common prefix has more than 3
## characters, they are replaced by ellipsis. For example, assume we are in
## a directory with files Screenshot_20170730.png and Screenshot_20170731.png.
## If using the default option, an auto completion prints
## Screenshot_20170730.png Screenshot_20170731.png.
## If this option is set, then the auto completion prints ...0.png ...1.png.
set completion-prefix-display-length 3

## Sets the completions to be listed immediately instead of ringing the
## bell when the completing word has more than one possible completion.
set show-all-if-ambiguous on

## Sets the completions to be listed immediately instead of ringing the bell
## when the completing word has more than one possible completion but no partial
## completion can be made.
set show-all-if-unmodified on

## Be more intelligent when autocompleting by also looking at the text after
## the cursor. For example, when the current line is "cd ~/src/mozil", and
## the cursor is on the "z", pressing Tab will not autocomplete it to "cd
## ~/src/mozillail", but to "cd ~/src/mozilla". (This is supported by the
# Readline used by Bash 4.)
set skip-completed-text on

## Sets completions to be appended by characters that indicate their
## file types reported by the stat system call.
